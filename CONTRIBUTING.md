# Opening an Issue
1. Explain in the most detailed way possible the problem you are experiencing.
2. Provide a complete traceback of the Python error message.
3. Leave an email address or at least make sure you will be notified if I comment on the issue. All the opened issues so far have just been abandoned by the users who opened them.
